Interviewing at Cumulus Digital Systems
This repo houses our candidate exercises intended to help demonstrate the mastery in your discipline.

The goal of these exercises is for it to serve the interviewee and the interview team as a conversation starter, so that you may get to know your future teammates. 
It is a take home assignment, and you should spend no more than a few hours on it. It is not meant to be 100% polished and ready for customers, it is meant to serve as a way of illustrating the way you think about problem solving.
