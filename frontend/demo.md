# General Description

The purpose of the demo is to give us a starting point for discussion of your approach to solving a problem and of your code. We are interested in learning how you approach this problem and go about solving it.
We expect this project to take experience developers familiar with technologies (HTML, CSS, javascript, React) a few hours to complete.
While we understand that everyone has limited time and may not address all the requirements, you may be asked how you might have solved a requirement you didn't get to if you had more time. 
On the other hand, if you want to extend the requirements (e.g., adding more extensive user input validation), you are welcome to do so as you see fit. 
Generally, we prefer higher code quality over more features for the purpose of the demo if you start to run out of time.
Use of your favorite libraries or frameworks is welcomed but optional. 

The requirements outlined below can be completed with or without a framework. 
We like using frameworks to help us deliver customer value faster, but be careful that you can still demonstrate your coding ability. 
For example, you might want to hand-code one of the validations on the form even if the framework already provides it.
Your demo should run on whichever web browser you prefer.

# Candidate Exercise Presentation Outline

[optional] it is optional to use the presentation slide. You can jump right into the code as well.
We have [PowerPoint template](../Cumulus%20Candidate%20Presentation%20Template.pptx) which covers an outline of what we would like to talk about during the first section of your interview before you share your craft demo. 
Feel free to use the template provided or make your own. For developers, we are more interested in your code than your PowerPoint skills, so plan your prep time accordingly.
When you show off your demo, we will ask you to show us how it works from a user's perspective (e.g., filling out the form and clicking "save"). 
After that, we will ask for a tour of your code with a focus on how you got the core functionality to work.

# The scenario

You are working on a user interface that allows customers to create, update and update actions needed to build a workflow. 
The project is to build a UI/Ux that is responsive, optimized for efficient visualization of data, and navigation.

See [project requirements](catalog-dialog.md) for more details.
